Understanding the Goal
Before we dive into the sequence, let's clarify the overall goal:

To provide clear, step-by-step instructions for processing survey data using the Response Uploader tool.
To improve efficiency by streamlining the process and reducing manual effort.
Proposed Sequence
Based on this understanding, here's a suggested order:

Step-by-Step Guide
Goal: Create a Response Uploader file.
Data Sources:
Download Survey 1 from the data and analysis tab.
Extract separate files for response ID, OrgUnitCode, and OrgUnitDescriptions for easy VLOOKUP.
Use AB data from the latest automation and the file shared by X.
Data Organization:
Create columns for Org.Unit Code, Org.Unit Description, NAOrhUnitCode, and NAOrhUnitDescription.
Populate these columns with data from the automation and the file shared by X.
Explanation: This step aims to standardize data format for efficient processing.
Data Preparation:
Use VLOOKUP to create a combined file with necessary information.
Data Upload:
Use the Response Uploader to import the prepared data.
Data Verification:
Perform a spot check to ensure data accuracy.
Add an UploadedDate column for tracking purposes.
Workflow Update:
Placeholder for Y to update the workflow.
