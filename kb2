1. Performance Analysis:

Content Performance: Analyze view count, helpful count, and ratings together to understand which versions of articles (based on Version field) perform better. This can help identify preferred writing styles, popular content categories (using Taxonomy), and preferred content length.
Version Comparison: Compare view counts, helpful counts, and ratings between different versions (Version field) of the same article to understand what revisions resonate with the audience.
2. User Engagement Analysis:

Engagement by Region: Analyze View Count and Helpful Count by Country to see which regions are most engaged with your content. This can help tailor content strategy for specific regions.
Workflow Impact: Analyze View Count and Helpful Count by Workflow value (Published, Review, Outdated, Draft) to see if workflow stages affect user engagement. This might suggest optimizing workflow efficiency.
3. Content Optimization:

Identify Underperforming Content: Use view counts and helpful counts to identify articles that might need revamping or refreshing based on low engagement.
Popular Content Areas: Analyze Taxonomy and View Count/Helpful Count together to see which content categories are most popular. This can help focus content creation efforts.
4. User Behavior Analysis:

Helpful Count vs Rating Analysis: Analyze the correlation between Helpful Count (thumbs up/down) and Rating (1-5 score) to understand user sentiment. Are high helpful counts always reflected in high ratings?
Engagement by Time: Analyze View Count and Helpful Count by Published date to see if there are seasonal trends or optimal publishing times.
Additionally:
